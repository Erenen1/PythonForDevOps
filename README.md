# Python for DevOps

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey into DevOps with Python. Here, I share the projects and scripts I have developed as I improve my skills in automation, monitoring, and DevOps practices.

## Future Plans

- Learn advanced Python libraries for DevOps (e.g., `boto3`, `paramiko`, `Docker SDK`).
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
- Explore infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible.
- Build Kubernetes-based deployments for scalable applications.
